# Hotel Database

This project was my first attempt at building a database.

The database stores information on rooms, reservations, and guests, as well as billing and promotional information.

At first, it was very difficult to wrap my head around the different types of relationships between data.
However, after spending a weekend of studying concepts and writing queries, the process became more natural.

Ironically, after struggling so much on this project, building databases has become one of my favorite parts
of building an application.
