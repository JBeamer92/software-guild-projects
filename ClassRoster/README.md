# Class Roster

An earlier project at the Guild, this project allows the user to keep track of a roster of students.

Using an MVC CRUD design pattern, the project persists data to a .txt file.

Knowing what I know now about databases, if I were asked to complete this project again, I would instead use 
a database to persist the data.
